## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- **Goal:** Classify surveillance videos into:
  - `shop_lifter`
  - `non_shop_lifter`
- **Dataset:** > 800 videos total, each with 16 frames (224x224, RGB)
- **Model:** Pretrained `EfficientNetB0_LSTM` 
- **Strategy:**
  - Extract embeddings from each video using frozen R3D-18.
  - Train a small binary classifier (MLP) or logistic regression on top.
  - Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
